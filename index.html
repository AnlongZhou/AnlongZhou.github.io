        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I am a student at Yuan Ze University, majoring in Computer Science and Information Engineering.
            My academic journey has given me a solid foundation in computer science principles, while my personal
            interests have led me to focus on web development.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy designing and building interactive, user-friendly websites that combine both functionality and
            aesthetics.
            Beyond coursework, I spend time exploring new frameworks, tools, and technologies to stay updated with
            the fast-paced field of software development.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the past few years, I have gained experience working with programming languages such as C, C++,
            and TypeScript (JavaScript), and I am currently expanding my skill set by learning Go.
            I am particularly interested in how backend development and cloud technologies can integrate with
            modern web applications, and I often challenge myself with small projects to put theory into practice.
        </p>

        <p>
            Looking ahead, I aim to further develop my skills in full-stack development and contribute to projects
            that solve real-world problems, while continuing to grow as a software engineer.
